# Image-classification-model-for-spectrum-data

This project involves the development and optimization of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform image classification on a set of spectrograms. 

The primary goal was to create a highly efficient, production-ready model that balances predictive accuracy with computational speed. 

Key Highlights: 
Efficiency-First Architecture: The final model architecture was selected through rigorous iteration and testing to provide the best performance while minimizing training time.
Advanced Data Handling: Utilizes the tf.data.Dataset structure for scalable, resource-efficient data loading. 
Model training employs AUTOTUNE for optimal performance based on hardware.
Transfer Learning Strategy: Explored and implemented EfficientNetB0 for superior performance with smaller datasets, strategically applying image augmentation to enhance generalization.
